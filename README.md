## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account (for database and storage)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash

   cd carbnb
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash

   ```
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
   DIRECT_URL="your_direct_postgresql_connection_string"
   SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_project_url"
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"
   JWT_SECRET="your_secure_jwt_secret"
   ```
   Initialize the database:

   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
   Start the server:

   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## 🔌 Database Maintenance
To ensure stability on platforms like Render or Supabase:
- **Connection Pooling**: The project uses a centralized Prisma client to manage database connections efficiently and prevent "Max Clients" errors.
- **Migrations**: Always run `npx prisma migrate dev` after updating the `schema.prisma`.
